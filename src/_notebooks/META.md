Meta information about the notebooks

COMP SETUP
- task, metric, etc

DATA SETUP FOR A DATASET
- download 1% of data 
- build dataframes
- write read_file(), visualize_df() functions

TORCH 
- build datamodules for all the input datasets
- experiment on the cheating kaggle notebooks
- train the models on my kaggle notebook and in future scale this part

END 
- write read_test() to build the test dataframe from the comp input 
- for now focus on winning gold by joining similar ranking people
- combine the models linearly and fit on leaderboard

FUTURE
-
