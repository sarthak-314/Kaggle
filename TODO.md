conda install -y pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
https://www.kaggle.com/gzuidhof/full-preprocessing-tutorial
https://github.com/albumentations-team/autoalbument-benchmarks/tree/main/conf for a good hydra architecture

just installed pytorch for now coz it's slow

- go though hydra, lightning callbacks & trainer very carefully 
- use OmegaConf and access config through dot notation OmegaConf.load('config.yaml')
- load the aug config and run config in the jupyter notebook
- https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics

CREATIVE MODE
- think about the architecture

MODERATELY ZONED IN MODE
- go through hydra docs, lightning callbacks & trainer
- auto augment paper and related


What can be changed

LIGHTNING
datamodule 
    - features, transformations 

model 
    - backbone, final_layer, metric, optimizer, scheduler

run 
    - trainer, overfitter, freeze and shot



FLOW OF DATA 
running an experiment needs trainer and a model

To breakup the dataflow, make small modules and control them with jupyter notebook
Try this strategy - if it can be broken up - then break it up

QUESTIONS 
- which augmentations to apply and how to apply 
  - augmentations for class imbalance
  - aug mix, cut mix stuff
- best way to structure and run experiments
- how to scale cheating 



IDEAS 
- class for bounding box?
